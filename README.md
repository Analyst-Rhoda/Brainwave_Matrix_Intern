## 🧾 Project Overview

This project focuses on the **retail electronics industry**, where transaction volumes are high, but meaningful insights are often buried beneath noise. The dataset used contains detailed information on thousands of electronic purchases — from smartphones to laptops and accessories.

The core goal of this project was to **unlock the value hidden in the sales data** and build a **comprehensive Power BI dashboard** that can help decision-makers:

- Understand customer purchasing behavior  
- Identify why and where revenue is leaking  
- Uncover the most and least profitable products and customer segments  
- Optimize order fulfillment and reduce cancellations  
- Make better marketing, inventory, and loyalty decisions

## ❗ Business Problem

Although sales were happening regularly, the business was facing several critical blind spots:

- 💸 **Millions in potential revenue were being lost to order cancellations** without clear reasons  
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Loyalty members weren’t spending more** than regular customers — was the program broken?  
- 🚫 **Add-ons (high-margin items)** were underutilized, despite clear opportunities to bundle them  
- 📉 No clear visibility into what **customer segments, shipping methods, or SKUs** were performing or underperforming

> These challenges pointed to one big issue: **decisions were being made without data-driven clarity**. This project aimed to fix that.

## ✅ Solution & Strategy

### 🎯 The Plan  
To solve the business problem, I took a structured approach that combined **data engineering, business analytics, and visual storytelling**.

### 🔧 Step 1: Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering (Python)
Using Python and Pandas in Google Colab:
- Removed duplicates, cleaned text inconsistencies (e.g., “Paypal” vs “PayPal”)
- Filled missing values intelligently (e.g., "No Add-ons" where blank)
- Created useful features:
  - `Add-on Count`
  - `Is Loyalty Member` (Boolean)
  - `Has Add-on`
  - `Age Group` (e.g., 18–25, 26–34)
  - `Year`, `Month`, `Day` from purchase date

Exported the cleaned dataset as `cleaned_electronic_sales.csv`.

### 📊 Step 2: Dashboard Development (Power BI)
Using Power BI, I designed a 53-page dashboard to make the analysis accessible and actionable:
1. **Executive Overview** – KPIs, revenue trends, product breakdown  
2. **Customer Insights** – Age group analysis, loyalty impact, gender breakdown  
3. **Order Fulfillment** – Completion vs cancellation, shipping method performance  

Created advanced DAX measures including:
- `Completed Revenue`, `Cancelled Revenue`
- `Revenue Change (%)`
- `Add-on Conversion Rate`
- `Average Order Value` (AOV) by customer type

## 🔍 Key Insights

Here’s what the data revealed when we finally let it speak:

### 1. 💥 Order Cancellations = ₦20.97M Lost
- **One-third** of all orders were cancelled — a massive hidden loss  
- Smartphones had both the highest sales and the highest cancellations

### 2. 👵 Older Customers (60+) Are Power Buyers
- They contributed **₦13.6M in revenue**, the most of any age group  
- Also purchased **the most add-ons**, signaling higher trust and loyalty

### 3. ➕ Add-ons = 35% Higher Revenue Per Order
- **75% of completed orders** included an add-on  
- Customers who bought add-ons consistently spent more

### 4. ❌ Loyalty Program Underperformance
- Loyalty members **didn’t spend more** than non-members  
- Suggests the program lacks meaningful incentives

### 5. 🚚 Shipping Type Matters
- **Standard shipping** orders were more likely to be cancelled  
- **Express/same-day shipping** had much better completion rates

## 📈 Results & Recommendations

### 🌟 What This Dashboard Enables
- Track and visualize revenue leakage from cancellations  
- Identify and focus on high-value customers and products  
- Spot and fix operational bottlenecks  
- Guide product bundling, loyalty program changes, and shipping upgrades

### ✅ Strategic Recommendations

1. **Revamp the Loyalty Program**
   - Introduce rewards, cashback, early access to sales
   - Promote through personalized email offers

2. **Target the 60+ Segment**
   - Offer add-on bundles, extended warranties, and phone support  
   - These customers are high trust and high spend

3. **Bundle Add-ons with Popular Products**
   - Pre-package accessories with smartphones, laptops  
   - Use bundles to boost perceived value

4. **Reduce Cancellations**
   - Improve delivery tracking, reduce “standard” delays  
   - Offer express upgrades for high-ticket items

5. **Capitalize on Seasonal Trends**
   - Ramp up inventory and marketing around **March, May, and November**
   - Launch clearance or loyalty-only sales in slow months (Feb, Oct, Dec)

## 🧠 Reflections & Learning

This wasn’t just a data project, it was a business transformation exercise.

Here’s what I learned:

- **Real-world data is messy** — but with the right approach, it tells clear stories  
- **Dashboards are more than charts** — they are tools for better decisions  
- You must **think like a business owner**, not just an analyst  
- Good analysis doesn’t just show *what*, it explains *why* — and suggests *what to do next*

> “Data is only valuable when it drives action.”
